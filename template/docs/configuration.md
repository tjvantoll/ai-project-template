# Configuration

How the device is configured. Every device setting must be documented here. (Dashboard settings are documented in [`dashboard/README.md`](../dashboard/README.md).)

## 1. Notecard configuration (applied by the firmware)

The firmware sends these settings to the Notecard at startup, so flashing the host is all it takes to set up a device. Change them here and in the firmware together.

<!-- Generator: fill from the Power, Location, Firmware updates, Notehub & data, and Configuration interview topics. Remove rows that don't apply, such as card.dfu when the device doesn't use Outboard Firmware Update. -->

| Setting | Value | Notecard request |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ProductUID | `{{PRODUCT_UID, e.g. com.your-company.your-name:your_product}}` | `hub.set` `product` |
| Sync mode | `{{default: periodic}}` | `hub.set` `mode` |
| Outbound interval | {{default: 60}} min | `hub.set` `outbound` |
| Inbound interval | {{default: 1440}} min | `hub.set` `inbound` |
| Voltage mode | `{{e.g. lipo}}` | `card.voltage` `mode` |
| Location mode | `{{default: off}}` | `card.location.mode` `mode` |
| Location tracking | {{off / on, writing _track.qo}} | `card.location.track` |
| Note templates | {{e.g. "sensors.qo"}} | `note.template` |
| Outboard Firmware Update | {{the card.dfu arguments for this carrier}} | `card.dfu` |
| Host firmware version | Reported on every boot from the version in the firmware source | `hub.set` `version` |

## 2. Notehub environment variables

Runtime settings that the firmware reads with [`env.get`](https://dev.blues.io/api-reference/notecard-api/env-requests/latest/#env-get). Change them in Notehub at the project, fleet, or device level without reflashing. The firmware falls back to the defaults below when a variable isn't set. See [Understanding Environment Variables](https://dev.blues.io/guides-and-tutorials/notecard-guides/understanding-environment-variables/).

<!-- Generator: suggest a variable for anything the user may want to tune after deployment. -->

| Variable | Default | Units | Set at | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{{e.g. sample_interval_min}}` | `{{e.g. 15}}` | {{e.g. minutes}} | {{project / fleet / device}} | {{e.g. How often the host takes a reading.}} |
