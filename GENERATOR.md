# Project generator instructions

**Audience: AI agents.** The user has asked you to create a new Blues IoT project from this generator. Follow these steps in order. The steps are a conversation with the user, not a batch job: keep them informed, ask before anything irreversible, and never invent hardware details.

Generator source: `https://github.com/tjvantoll/ai-project-template` (branch `main`). If the user points you at a local copy of the generator, use that instead.

## Ground rules

- **Ask, don't guess.** Pins, part numbers, Notefile names, units, and thresholds come from the user or from documentation you looked up. If neither is available, write `TBD` and move on.
- **Look things up instead of asking** when the answer is in Blues documentation, e.g. a Notecarrier's default Notecard interface, Feather pin mappings, or the right `card.voltage` mode. Tell the user what you looked up. See [Looking things up](#looking-things-up).
- **Ask a few questions at a time** (2–4), grouped by topic. [`generator/options.md`](./generator/options.md) gives each topic's default and the docs page that lists its choices: read the page, offer the choices, and mark the default. Use your tool's multiple-choice question UI if it has one.
- **Keep `SETUP.md` up to date** in the new project (see the Scaffold step) so that setup can resume in a later session. Check a step when it's done, or when the user decides not to do it (add "(skipped)"). Leave a step unchecked, with a short note, when it's partly done or put off until later.
- **Ask before** creating anything in Notehub, flashing hardware, or running commands that touch a connected device.

## Looking things up

Use the Blues Expert MCP when its tools are available. Early in setup they usually aren't, because the project's MCP config only loads when the agent restarts. Until then, start at https://dev.blues.io/llms.txt, which explains how to read the Blues docs as Markdown.

Read pages directly or save them to a temporary folder. Don't save copies of docs pages in the project; component datasheets go in `docs/datasheets/`.

## Placeholders

Template files mark unanswered values with `{{…}}`. Replace the whole placeholder, braces included, with the answer.

- `{{default: …}}` holds the generator's default. Write it only if the user accepted the default.
- Anything else inside the braces, whether a name like `PROJECT_NAME`, an example, a list of options, or a question, describes what belongs there. Never copy it into the project.

Anything still unanswered becomes `TBD`.

## Step 0: Prepare

1. **Find the target folder.** Default to the current working directory. If it isn't empty (ignoring `.git`), ask whether to use it anyway or create a subfolder.
2. **Get the generator files** into a temporary folder outside the target, and note the commit they came from:
   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tjvantoll/ai-project-template <temp-dir>
   git -C <temp-dir> rev-parse HEAD
   ```
   If `git` is unavailable, use `curl` and `tar` (`curl.exe` and `tar.exe` on Windows). The first command prints the commit:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.sha" https://api.github.com/repos/tjvantoll/ai-project-template/commits/main
   mkdir <temp-dir>
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/tjvantoll/ai-project-template/archive/<commit>.tar.gz | tar -xz -C <temp-dir> --strip-components 1
   ```
   Don't fetch the files with a web-fetch tool that summarizes pages: they must arrive verbatim.
3. Read `generator/options.md` from the generator source.

## Step 1: Scaffold

1. Copy everything in `template/` (including dotfiles) into the target folder. Don't copy anything outside `template/`.
2. Create `CLAUDE.md` in the target folder containing exactly `@AGENTS.md`.
3. Create `SETUP.md` in the target folder from [SETUP.md contents](#setupmd-contents), replacing `<commit>` with the commit from Prepare. (For a local copy of the generator, link its `GENERATOR.md` path instead.) Check off "Scaffold."
4. If the folder isn't a git repository, run `git init`.
5. Tell the user what you created, and that the project includes MCP config for Blues Expert and Notehub MCP. If the Blues Expert tools aren't available to you yet, give the user a choice: approve the servers and restart their agent in this folder now, then say "continue the project setup", so the interview can use Blues Expert; or carry on now, and you'll use the docs as described in [Looking things up](#looking-things-up).

## Step 2: Interview

Work through these topics in order. Record answers as you go: fill in the matching placeholders in the target project's files after each topic, not all at the end. This keeps progress safe if the session ends.

| Topic | Ask about | Writes to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product | Project name; who's building it (an organization, or the user's name), which goes into the firmware's version info; one-sentence summary; what problem it solves and for whom; where it's deployed and how many units; what "working correctly" looks like. | `README.md`, `docs/product.md` |
| Kit | Whether they're starting from a Blues kit, and which one. A kit answers the Notecard, Notecarrier, and Host topics: look up its parts, confirm the SKU printed on the Notecard, and skip those three. | `docs/hardware.md` |
| Notecard | Model family and exact SKU. | `docs/hardware.md` |
| Notecarrier | Model and version, or custom carrier. | `docs/hardware.md` |
| Host | Host MCU or SBC. Skip if the Notecarrier has a built-in host. | `docs/hardware.md` |
| Components | Every sensor, actuator, display, battery, antenna, and enclosure, with part numbers and datasheet links. Offer to save datasheets to `docs/datasheets/`. | `docs/hardware.md` |
| Firmware updates | How host firmware gets updated in the field, if at all. Ask before Wiring, because some methods need extra wiring. | `docs/hardware.md`, `docs/configuration.md` |
| Wiring | Notecard ↔ host interface (I2C default, or serial); ATTN/AUX pin usage; firmware update lines, if the method needs them; one row per component connection (pin → pin, bus, address, voltage). | `docs/hardware.md` |
| Power | Power source; `card.voltage` mode; sleep strategy; battery-life target. | `docs/hardware.md`, `docs/configuration.md` |
| Location | Whether the device needs its location, and how often (`card.location.mode`); whether to record a track. | `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/data.md` |
| Firmware | Platform and build tool (default: Arduino + Arduino CLI); board identifier (FQBN / PlatformIO env); what the firmware should do; starting version (default: 1.0.0). | `firmware/README.md` |
| Notehub & data | Notehub project name and ProductUID (or "not created yet"); sync mode and cadence; Notefiles with fields, types, units, and normal ranges; what healthy and offline look like. | `docs/data.md`, `docs/configuration.md` |
| Data routing | Where events should go after Notehub, if anywhere (default: nowhere yet). | `docs/data.md` |
| Configuration | Runtime settings that should be changeable from Notehub (env vars with defaults). Whether to use note templates (default: yes, for each outbound Notefile). | `docs/configuration.md` |
| Dashboard | Whether they want one now, later, or never; preferred framework (default: Next.js). | `dashboard/README.md` |

Tips:

- If Notehub MCP is available and the user already has a Notehub project, offer to read the ProductUID, existing Notefiles, and environment variables from Notehub instead of asking.
- If the user doesn't know their Notefiles yet, propose a design based on the components and product goals (e.g. one `.qo` for periodic readings) and confirm it with them.
- Suggest environment variables for any value they might want to tune after deployment, such as the sample interval.

When the interview is done, check off "Interview" in `SETUP.md`.

## Step 3: Finalize docs

1. Make sure `docs/*.md` and `README.md` agree with each other (Notefile names, ProductUID, env vars, voltage mode, location mode, sync settings, firmware update method).
2. Make sure the choices work together. For each Notecard request in `docs/configuration.md`, and for the firmware update method, read its docs page and confirm that the user's Notecard supports it and that the other settings meet its requirements, such as a mode it needs. Resolve any conflict with the user.
3. Remove every template guidance comment (`<!-- ... -->`) from the generated Markdown files.
4. Search `README.md` and `docs/` for `{{`. Replace any remaining placeholder with `TBD` (see [Placeholders](#placeholders)), and list it in `SETUP.md` under "Open questions." Leave the placeholders in `firmware/README.md` and `dashboard/README.md` for their own steps.
5. Check off "Docs" in `SETUP.md` and offer to make the first git commit.

## Step 4: Check the MCP servers

Confirm that the Blues Expert and Notehub MCP tools are available.

- If they aren't, tell the user how to enable them: approve the servers in `.mcp.json` (Claude Code), `.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor), or `.vscode/mcp.json` (VS Code), or for other tools add HTTP MCP servers named "Blues Expert" (`https://mcp.blues.io/expert/mcp`) and "Notehub MCP" (`https://mcp.notehub.io/mcp`). Usually they then need to restart the agent in the project folder and say "continue the project setup." Stop here until they do.
- Blues Expert is required for the Firmware step. Notehub MCP is required for the Notehub IQ step and helpful for the Notehub project and Firmware steps.

## Step 5: Notehub project

The firmware needs a ProductUID, so the Notehub project comes first.

1. If the user doesn't have a Notehub project yet, ask them to create one at https://notehub.io (or create it with Notehub MCP if they ask you to).
2. Record the ProductUID in `docs/data.md` and `docs/configuration.md`.
3. If the user wants project-level values for the environment variables in `docs/configuration.md` now, set them with Notehub MCP (with their approval). Otherwise the firmware's defaults apply.
4. If `docs/data.md` lists routes, offer to create them with Notehub MCP (with their approval), or point the user to the project's Routes page in Notehub. Routes usually need credentials for the destination: have the user enter those in Notehub rather than paste them into the chat.
5. Check off "Notehub project" in `SETUP.md`.

## Step 6: Firmware

Ask whether to generate firmware now. If yes:

1. Call Blues Expert `firmware_entrypoint` and follow its guidance for the chosen platform.
2. Read `docs/hardware.md`, `docs/data.md`, and `docs/configuration.md`. Write firmware in `firmware/` that matches them exactly: same pins, Notefiles, field names, env vars, and defaults.
3. The firmware applies the Notecard configuration from `docs/configuration.md` at startup (`hub.set` with the ProductUID and sync settings, `card.voltage`, `card.location.mode`, `note.template`, and `card.dfu` when `docs/hardware.md` calls for Outboard Firmware Update), so that flashing the host is all it takes to set up a device. No Notecard CLI step is needed.
4. The firmware reports its version at startup with the `version` argument of `hub.set`, so Notehub shows which version each device runs. (`hub.set` works on every Notecard; `dfu.status` doesn't.) Use the object form, with `org` and `builder` set to who's building it from `docs/product.md`. Keep the version in one place in the source.
5. Validate every Notecard request with Blues Expert `api_validate`.
6. Build the firmware. Fix errors until it compiles. If the toolchain isn't installed, give the user install commands and ask before running them.
7. Update `firmware/README.md` with the real layout and build, flash, and monitor commands.
8. Ask whether the device is connected and whether to flash it. If yes, flash it and watch the serial output for Notecard errors.
9. Using Notehub MCP, confirm that the device appears in the project and that its events match `docs/data.md`. Fix any differences in the firmware or the docs.
10. Check off "Firmware" in `SETUP.md`.

## Step 7: Notehub IQ

Once the device has sent events:

1. With the user's approval, onboard the Notehub project with Notehub MCP.
2. Create datasets for each Notefile in `docs/data.md`, plus `_session.qo` and `_health.qo` (and `_track.qo` if the device records a track). Follow Notehub MCP's dataset guidance first: dataset columns are permanent.
3. Try a first question with the user, e.g. "Are my devices behaving as described in docs/data.md?"
4. Check off "Notehub IQ" in `SETUP.md`.

## Step 8: Dashboard (optional)

If the user wants a dashboard now:

1. Build it in `dashboard/` with the chosen framework. Call the Notehub API from server-side code only, using the variables in `dashboard/.env.example`. Never expose the access token to the browser.
2. Have the user create a Notehub access token limited to this project, as `dashboard/README.md` describes.
3. Use the Notefile names, fields, and units in `docs/data.md`.
4. Add new environment variables to `dashboard/.env.example` and the table in `dashboard/README.md`.
5. Update `dashboard/README.md` with how to run and deploy it.
6. Check off "Dashboard" in `SETUP.md` (or mark it skipped).

## Step 9: Finish

1. Make sure `README.md` is still short: name, description, and links. Details belong in `docs/`, `firmware/README.md`, and `dashboard/README.md`.
2. Search the project's Markdown files for `{{`. Replace any remaining placeholder with `TBD` and list it in `SETUP.md` under "Open questions." This catches the firmware and dashboard placeholders when those steps were skipped.
3. If "Open questions" in `SETUP.md` is empty and every step is checked, delete `SETUP.md`. Otherwise keep it and tell the user what's left.
4. Offer to commit.
